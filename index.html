    <h1>Hollow Attack</h1>
    <h2>By Robert Regala</h2>
    <p>This story is a web comic about a monster known as a hollow that is attacking the city and the hero has to stop it. I made this comic because I was inspired by an anime known as Bleach. I converted my sketches into digital files using Adobe Illustrator.</p>
